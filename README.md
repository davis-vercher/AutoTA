# AutoTA
This project entailed designing an AWS cloud system architecture to solve for a specific Architectural Kata [(Check Your Work)](https://www.architecturalkatas.com/kata.html?kata=CheckYourWork.json), and was completed as a major cloud system design project for the Master of Science in Computer Science program at Southern Methodist University (Spring 2025).


## Kata Requirements
#### _From the Kata, linked above:_
A university has greatly expanded its CS course and wants to be able to automate the grading of simple programming assignments.

Users: 300+ students per year, plus staff and admin.

Requirements: Students must be able to upload their source code, which will be run and graded. Grades and runs must be persistent and auditable. There must be a plagiarism detection system involving comparing with other submissions and also submitting to a web-based service (TurnItIn). There must be some level of integration with the University's learning management system (LMS)


## Lessons Learned & Experience Gained
- Without prior AWS experience, designing a theoretically functional AWS system provided many opportunities for research into various AWS tools/services, which was done to identify the specific components of the final system architecture.
- Additionally, thinking through the integration of the AWS architecture to an existing university learning management system (in this case, Canvas) provided an opportunity to investigate the feasibility of such an integration.
